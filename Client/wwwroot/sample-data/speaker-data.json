    "bio": "Being the CEO of Animation Research Limited, one of Australasia's leading Computer Graphics production houses, seemed an unlikely career choice for Cheryl Adams when she was grubbing thistles on her parent's farm.  After all, she was going to be an accountant, until a calculus teacher suggested she'd get bored and advised her to head to engineering school.  Cheryl's journey from mechanical engineer through the energy sector and into award winning computer graphics, is a story of practical empathy, and proves the wisdom of her calculus teacher:  her life is far from boring.
