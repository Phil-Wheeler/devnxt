              We love attending technical conferences. Codemania, Microsoft Ignite, WDC, KawaiiCon&hellip; they offer some great topics and 
              have uniformly brilliant speakers, but we thought something was missing. What is there for the senior developers, the technical 
              leads, the engineering managers who are looking at ways to help their teams and decide where to devote more of their efforts 
              in the personal growth and people-facing skills?
          </p>
          <p>
              That&rsquo;s why Peter and Phil decided to create DevNxt. DevNxt is a conference for aspiring people leaders, team contributors, 
              and all the other generative roles out there in the technical space of software product delivery. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what 
              your tech stack is; the unifying theme across all technology problems is that there are no technology problems. Only 
              people-facing problems.
          </p>
          <p>
              DevNxt is a full day in scenic Dunedin, hearing from respected and recognised technical leaders on a range of topics that apply to all levels 
              of your business technology capability. From senior developers, architects, team leaders and team members aspiring to move into 
              leadership roles (or even those who are unsure if it&rsquo;s the right thing for them), our speaker topics will provide a 
              personal and insightful window into those next steps.
