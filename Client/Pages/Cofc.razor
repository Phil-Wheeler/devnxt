          <p>
              DevNxt is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and 
              expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment 
              of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including 
              talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion 
              of the conference organisers.
          </p>
          <p>
              Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, 
              disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, 
              following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, 
              and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
              If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including 
              warning the offender or expulsion from the conference. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, 
              or have any other concerns, please contact the conference organisers immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
              The conference organisers will be happy to help those experiencing harassment to feel safe. We value your attendance. We expect 
              participants to follow these rules at all venues and DevNxt-related events (e.g. after-parties and workshops).
